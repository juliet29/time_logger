- nice job with finding the water index!
- I appreciate the clarity and simplicity, great clean energy index. Thorough data source exploration 
- Really interesting that you included a deeper dive into the HDI systems diagram, I really liked how this visual helped draw a parallel between HDI and your USSI. Also, awesome in-depth systems models for your terms!
- I like that they're focusing on a smaller number of indices and getting more granular and specific. It was a good discussion of specific data sources as well, probably since there was a less amount of indices. 
- I like that you started with the green city index to help guide your analysis. It was helpful to have your stock and flow diagrams broken out by each of the 8 metrics to provide clear understanding of each factor. 
- Very thorough!
- It's really great that the link to the data is included in each of the metrics. It would be interesting to see how all the indices react to each other.
- 7/8 components of their USSI are all indices. Their USSI seems very inclusive
- Yay!
