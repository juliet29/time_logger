- I like how the group thought about normalizing the data!
- I really liked how they did their weighting and showed their normalization process. 
- I liked the worked example of how you calculated the scales score, made a lot of sense! 
- Very thorough method of calculating scores! Having it all on a scale of 0 to 1 helps compare and understand the value. I would like to know more about the classification of each metric as a stock
- More emphasis could be laid to improve the weighting mechanism involved in the project.
- I like the weighting they used (system's based weighting). I also like the acknowledgement of how hard it is to come by global city data. 
- Core components and cross components division are very innovative, there are some factors which require special attention and should be core components. They sum up 80% of the systems and hence they should be given priority while dealing with the problems 
- I really appreciated how comprehensive the calculations slide was!
- Great slide deck visuals
- I liked the inverted, normalizing system for certain terms where a higher number means worse sustainability metrics. 
- The explanation of the complexity/interconnection was a bit vague but otherwise it was a good presentation! 
- Great discussion on the reason for developing a sustainability index for cities and how cities will become even more important as a driver for the future. Also liked including a discussion on qualitative factors regarding the cities. Very important.
