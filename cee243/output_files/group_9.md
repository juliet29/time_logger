================

- interesting use of congressional districts in dividing up areas, and comprehensive study of tree canopy as well as other metrics! Also love the graphics
- nice graphics! I love that they incorporated policy. Our group was considering that but weren't sure how to glad someone found a way
- Good analysis of Clean City Index and how it can show future adaptability, strong focus on human flourishing
- Google tree canopy imaging is a really cool source! Temporal snapshot versus longterm is a good concern! Hard to know how this should weigh in on ussi score.
- Well explained presentation! I thought the energy scorecard was a really unique and interesting metric. 
- I'm curious about using HDI as the highest weight for a sustainability score. Not to say that human development isn't important, I'm just not sure it is the most telling metric for city-wide sustainability (from a forward looking climate impact perspective) 
- Really clear and concise but comprehensive presentation, great job!
- found city clean energy scorecard which seems pretty inclusive of a lot of significant factors
- I appreciate how thorough the motivation was for this project, and really taking an emphasis on human life/lifestyle.
