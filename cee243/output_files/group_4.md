================

- cool approach about editing an existing metric and comparing results
- Great idea to use an existing effort (SCI) to reference and base their USSI off of, but also use as a way to figure out what they want to differentiate. This was also probably a great way to ensure the cities they were going to look at had relatively good data. 
- The indicator radar charts were so interesting - I really appreciated this visual aid for the ranking system
- I am interested to know what a mental health as a stock means , and interested to hear more about how the data is normalized across countries or changing cities with better metrics 
- I like how you used existing sustainability benchmark to confirm important indicator factors to focus on. I'm curious how you'll handle metrics in the USSI that are not available for all 5 cities
- Good job!
- nice job looking at existing metrics!
