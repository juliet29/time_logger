================

- I like the visualization of stocks and metrics under the 4 indices that were picked!
- Appreciated the consideration of how to look at productivity (traditionally GDP) in terms of sustainability 
- Great presentation. Enjoyed the Data and Model limitations slide, as it resonated with the findings and thoughts of our group. 
- Great exploration of the data sources
- I thought this was a really clear and comprehensive presentation! The only critique I have is some of the slides were hard to read due to the background color (like the black text on a red background was difficult for me to read from the back of the classroom). However, I was really impressed by the breadth of your data availability search/analysis!
- Thorough data breakdown, very clear 
- job-house ratio would be interesting to look at
- Great project! 
- interesting use of job to house ratio and incorporation of health metrics, comprehensive overviews of data availability
- good job!
