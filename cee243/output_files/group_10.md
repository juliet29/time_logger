=================

- very well presented
- agree with the reasoning to add the weighting system and I learned about the analytic hierarchy process (AHP)
- Great presentation, very detailed and clear. It set the bar high!
- I would like to hear more about the specific terms and how you found data/calculated as opposed to the high level
- Great presentation and justification 
- Great presentation. Very clear discussion on their methodology (AHP), metrics, and data exploration. 
- Loved the discussion of the data and model limitations!
- It would be helpful to note which are inflows / outflows with arrows, I'm interested in learning more about how each of these factors interact with each other 
- I really liked seeing the group's application of the weighing system. It was very thorough.
- love the graphs
- The limitations of the data and model are well explained & the AHP is great to differentiate the weighting of each indicator. 
- very cool and comprehensive!
- Wow! Very thorough!
- I was not convinced on how they are going to solve the issue of normalising the values across different units.
