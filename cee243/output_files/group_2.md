- would this USSI be able to be applied to non-C40 cities or is the data just not there? I liked that the stocks were very simplified but had a lot of inflows and outflows that were quantified
- I really appreciated the context of defining sustainability - this really helped to provide a foundation for the methodology/justification of your USSI. 
- Great presentation. I especially liked the discussion on the definition of Sustainability. Really thought-provoking as it varies so widely is the foundation of what we're doing in this project. 
- Great job!
- Really thorough investigation and acknowledgement of challenges and potential redesign.  Love how you looked at different definitions of sustainability and the C40 database
- Great and very clear about the stock/flow diagram and source of the data
- great job sharing your data sources
- good graphics
- I really enjoyed their systems diagram showing the intersections of all the indexes.
