- Great use of graphics in the ppt 
- interesting that they centered everything about humans and life expectancy, cool perspective!
- I enjoyed their illustration and discussion of how they brainstormed. Really good discussion on data findings and disparities that may not be reflected enough in the available data. 
- Lowest common denominator seems like a good guiding factor (although limiting) for city selection. Significant disparities of sustainability within cities as well! Good point! 
- interesting variety of cities , good discussion of general findings on data availability , and acknowledging disparities within cities 
- I thought it was really interesting how you chose to break down the USSI terms into the three categories of how they relate to life expectancy. This really helped simplify the conceptualization of your model and highlight the most important factors, great job!
- I think it's really interesting to think about how different metrics impact human life expectancy! Really unique approach, but makes a lot of sense.
- Great data findigns 
- Tree coverage is interesting indicator (ample data?)  
- Good work!
