- The focus on California made sense and I like how it gives a narrower scope. Really clear slides, loved it. 
- Great idea to narrow down the scope to California! Graphics for data sources was awesome
- I liked the unique California focus and presentation style. Affordability was also something I hadn't considered for the index but makes complete sense and is great to include. 
- Great job!
- very insightful on how they came up with their USSI. 
- Good analysis of the system. More information and comments on choosing the indices would be more helpful.
- I understand that CA has a lot of data availability, but the project does ask for scalability in different parts of the world/country. I wonder if this USSI can be applied to areas similar to CA. Maybe more "progressive" counties or cities.
- Very interesting that they took the perspective of affordability and livability metrics, along with the systems metrics perspective. 
- Interesting definition of scope, engaging and clear graphics! It would be interesting to apply this metric to suburbs vs. urban areas to see how they perform overall
- Love love LOVE the logo y'all created! All of the graphics were super helpful for visualizing the USSI model.
- city selection strategy: will have interesting and possibly more applicable results since focused on California
- Really interesting discussion/justification of geographic scope - great job!! I would've liked to see a greater exploration of data sources/limits somewhere in the presentation
- It does seem like you have a lot of metrics so you might be limited by the data sources available
